# Loyalty Contracts

See NextJS app that goes with these contracts:
https://github.com/theljwhite/loyalty

This is a new repo for on-chain loyalty program smart contracts and optional escrow contracts.

The first version of the contracts were done in a separate repo using Truffle to test, etc.

For the second version of the contracts, I've decided to continue the work using Hardhat instead of Truffle. So I will begin cleaning up the contracts that are basically prototypes here in this repo.

Using Hardhat, I can also utilize TypeScript to test the contracts as opposed to JavaScript which I was using with Truffle initially simply because it was quicker.
